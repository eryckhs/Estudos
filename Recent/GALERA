Title : Configuring Galera Cluster with MariaDB.
Author: Eryck Santos <eryck.ehs@gmail.com> 
Description: This document is to be used to configure Galera cluster whit MariaDB. This covers only the basic configuration, 
expected to be extended with time. There is also a section covering problems that may occour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before installing:

If you are using a recent version of your OS, you may try to skip this part and go to 'Installing', since this part 
only convers how to prepare your repositories to download mariaDB.

There may be some cases where the MariaDB package can not be found in the default debaian repositories (apt). in these 
cases you would have to add extras repo's to get the MariaDB package. this can be easily achived by following the 
digitalocean guide (step 1). But it will also be covered here.

Generate the MariaDB repo:
Access https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config to generate the repo and follow with the guide on to how to add it
to your files. It is also needed to import a key to access the repository. I recommend following with the page guide, 
but if you have no internet connection, first you wont even be able to download the thing but, you may try the following.

    # (copy n paste in terminal)
      sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https curl
      sudo curl -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc 'https://mariadb.org/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc'
      sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://mirror1.cl.netactuate.com/mariadb/repo/10.10/debian bullseye main' >>/etc/apt/sources.list"

Note that this is to be done to all the cluster Nodes!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing:

With the repo configured and the key imported, install mariadb with:

    sudo apt-get update
    #sudo apt-get install mariadb-server

Since version 10.4, galera cluster is added in the mariaDB package, so you only need to install mariaDB. rsync is also
considered a dependencie of mariaDB and will be downloaded with it, but do make sure it is installed.

    # sudo apt-get install rsync
    
You may also want install a firewall for security:

    # sudo apt-get install firewalld
    
With mariaDB installed you may run:

    # mysql_secure_install

This will run a script that will configure your mariaDB server and add a root password. Remember ADD A ROOT PASSWORD!
the rest you may select yes.

Note that this is to be done to all the cluster Nodes!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Galera and MariaDB:

To set up a galera cluster you have to edit a configuration file. mariaDB will look into /etc/mysql/conf.d directory
for files with .cnf to configure the service.

create a file called galera.cnf:

    # vim /etc/mysql/conf.d/galera.cnf
    
and copy the following text:
    
    [mysqld]
    binlog_format=ROW
    default-storage-engine=innodb
    innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
    bind-address=0.0.0.0

    # Galera Provider Configuration
    wsrep_on=ON
    wsrep_provider=/usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so

    # Galera Cluster Configuration
    wsrep_cluster_name="cluster_training"
    wsrep_cluster_address="gcomm://<NODE_IP1><NODE_IP2><NODE_IP3>"

    # Galera Synchronization Configuration
    wsrep_sst_method=rsync

    # Galera Node Configuration
    wsrep_node_address="<NODE_IP>"
    wsrep_node_name="<NODE_NAME>"

These lines are to be changed with the nodes IP addresses and the node name.
It is also nedded to set the 'bind-address' to 0.0.0.0 to enable other IPs to use the server.
for more details on each config, visit: https://galeracluster.com/library/training/tutorials/configuration.html

There may occour some problems regarding the 'wsrep_provider' file. If your mariaDB service does not start, and the
logs file indicate that there are no such file or directory, it may be necessary to change this file in the config file.
to find the right file path, use: find / -name libgalera_smm.so and paste the path into the config file.

Note that wsrep stands for WriteSet Replication, and galera is a wsrep provider.
Note that this is to be done to all the cluster Nodes! Each with its own IP address.
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firewall configuration:

If you have a firewall installed in your server, which you should, the you need to open some ports as to enable
galera cluster to function properly. Galera uses 5 ports:

Port 3306 tcp For MySQL client connections and State Snapshot Transfer that use the mysqldump method.
port 4567 tcp/udp For Galera Cluster replication traffic. Multicast replication uses both UDP transport and TCP on this port.
port 4568 tcp For Incremental State Transfer.
port 4444 tcp For all other State Snapshot Transfer.

for our case, we installed firewalld and here is how to configure it: 

    root@Galera-1:/etc/selinux# systemctl enable firewalld
    root@Galera-1:/etc/selinux# systemctl start firewalld
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=mysql --permanent
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3306/tcp --permanent
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4444/tcp --permanent
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4567/tcp --permanent
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4568/tcp --permanent
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4567/udp --permanent
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# firewall-cmd --reload
    success
    root@Galera-1:/home/eryck# 

Note that this is to be done to all the cluster Nodes! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting the cluster:

First, it is nedded to stop mariaDB service in all servers:

    # sudo systemctl stop mysql
    
This is done to ensure that the cluster is inicialized in the correct order.
When you do start a cluster node, it will try to find other nodes, based on the configuration, so that it can start
copying its data and a galera cluster node CANNOT  function in stand alone.
So, as to avoid errors, all mariaDB are to be stopped and to configure each node at a time.

In the first node type:
    
    # sudo galera_new_cluster

This will start the mariaDB and galera cluster services.
If no errors occour you may access mariaDB  and type the following to check the status of the cluster:

    # mysql -u root -p 
    #: SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size'
    
the output will show the cluster size.

Next you may bring up your other nodes simply by starting the mysql service:

    # sudo systemctl start mysql
    
You may also try logging in mariaDB and checking the Cluster status wtih the same command
    
    #: SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size'

success
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing Replication:

Access a node, write some data, create some tables and databases and check if they are being shared correctly.
if not, good luck solving it :3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What to do AFTER closing all nodes:

MariaDB and galera cluster have a way to ensure data loss prevention by not allowing your nodes to bootup in the wrong 
order. When all of your nodes get shutdown you have to start galera cluster on the last node to shutdown.
if you dont remember the last one, just try booting up each one with: galera_new_cluster and the right one will work.
This is safe to do because there is a configuration in /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat file, called bootstrap, that prevents
the wrong node from starting

ALWAYS, ALWAYS CHECK THE LOGS!
